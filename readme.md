*Gameplay Instructions*
This game is the traditional Tic Tac Toe game. One player represents "X" and the other represents "O". The players take turns marking one square on a 9x9 board with their letter one at a time. The first player to get 3 squares in a row with their letter wins! If all squares are marked but there is no winner the game ends in a tie. The 3 squares can be in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

When the game starts you can select between playing against the computer or two player mode. Player 1 is "X" and player 2 (or the AI in vs. computer mode) is "O". "X" always goes first.

You can mark a square by clicking on it. When the game is over because someone won or it's a tie, the game will let you know and will give you the option to restart and play again.
